        <h2>Option 2: DAO under a Large Company (e.g., McDermott)</h2>

 

        <h3>Strengths:</h3>

        <ul>

            <li>Access to assured work from McDermott's aging fleet.</li>

        </ul>

    </div>

 

    <div class="swot-block">

        <h2>Option 3: DAO on Our Own</h2>

 

        <h3>Strengths:</h3>

        <ul>

            <li>Full control over DAO operations and processes.</li>

            <li>Trustworthy leadership with H Antar as head of DAO.</li>

            <li>Lack of administrative structure and potential high costs.</li>

        <h2>Summary of DAO SWOT Analysis:</h2>

 

        <h3>Best Option: DAO on Our Own:</h3>

        <ul>

            <li>This option provides full control over operations, processes, and leadership, which is critical for long-term growth and flexibility. Although there are challenges such as a lack of administrative structure and high liability, the freedom to collaborate with other DAOs and DARs makes it the best option overall.</li>

        </ul>

 

        <h3>Worst Option: DAO under a Large Company (e.g., McDermott)</h3>

        <ul>

            <li>This option offers assured work, but the main drawbacks include less control over hourly salaries and possible misalignment with McDermott's interests. The need to establish the DAO outside Quebec is manageable, but the reduced flexibility and potential lack of autonomy make this the least favorable option. </li>
