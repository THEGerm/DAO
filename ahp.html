    <h1>Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP)</h1>

    <div class="option-block">

        <h2>Description:</h2>

        <p>AHP is a structured technique for organizing and analyzing complex decisions. It involves breaking down the decision problem into a hierarchy of more easily comprehensible sub-problems, each of which can be analyzed independently.</p>

    </div>

 

    <div class="option-block">

        <h2>Application:</h2>

        <p>For selecting an organizational structure, AHP helps in comparing various COAs by pairwise comparison and uses mathematical calculations to derive priority scales to determine which option best meets the overall objectives.</p>

    </div>

 

    <div class="option-block">

        <h2>Criteria for Evaluation:</h2>

        <ul>

            <li>Control and Influence: Importance of having control over operations and influence in decision-making processes. MEDIUM-HIGH</li>

            <li>Certification Experience: The value of having existing experience with relevant aircraft certifications and standards (DO-160, DO-254, DO-178). MEDIUM-HIGH</li>

            <li>Liability Management: Importance of minimizing personal liability for team members. LOW</li>

            <li>Cost and Administrative Relief: Ease of administrative tasks, costly administration and support provided by the company structure. MEDIUM</li>

            <li>Project Acquisition: Ability to secure projects and work opportunities. MEDIUM-LOW</li>

            <li>Trust and Reliability: Trustworthiness and reliability of partners or associated companies. HIGH</li>

            <li>Location Advantage: Strategic advantage based on location, particularly in relation to Transport Canada. MEDIUM-LOW</li>

        </ul>

        <h2>Option Analysis Using Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP):</h2>

 

        <h3>Control and Influence (Medium-High Importance):</h3>

        <ul>

            <li>Option 1: Limited control due to AeroDonia's desire to use their own director as head of DAO. Medium influence within a small company.</li>

            <li>Option 2: Less control due to being part of a large company, but some potential influence through negotiations.</li>

            <li>Option 3: High control and influence as the DAO would be independently managed by the team.</li>

        </ul>

 

        <h3>Certification Experience (Medium-High Importance):</h3>

        <ul>

            <li>Option 1: Limited experience in DO-254 and no experience in DO-178, some experience in DO-160.</li>

            <li>Option 2: No direct experience but access through partnerships; Tim provides some DO-160 experience.</li>

            <li>Option 3: No direct experience but access to documents and subcontracting is possible.</li>

        </ul>

 

        <h3>Liability Management (Low Importance):</h3>

        <ul>

            <li>Option 1: Liability rests on AeroDonia.</li>

            <li>Option 2: Liability rests on McDermott.</li>

            <li>Option 3: Full liability on team members.</li>

        </ul>

 

        <h3>Cost and Administrative Relief (Medium Importance):</h3>

        <ul>

            <li>Option 1: Admin relief provided by AeroDonia with payroll benefits.</li>

            <li>Option 2: Less administrative relief compared to Option 1, depends on negotiations.</li>

            <li>Option 3: High administrative burden; costly and time-consuming setup.</li>

        </ul>

 

        <h3>Project Acquisition (Medium-Low Importance):</h3>

        <ul>

            <li>Option 1: Some project opportunities through AeroDonia’s contacts in the industry.</li>

            <li>Option 2: Assured work from McDermott’s aging fleet and international connections.</li>

            <li>Option 3: Requires effort and resources to find projects independently.</li>

        </ul>

 

        <h3>Trust and Reliability (High Importance):</h3>

        <ul>

            <li>Option 1: Trust issues with AeroDonia's disorganization and reliability concerns highlighted by team experiences.</li>

            <li>Option 2: Potential reliability due to large company structure, though interest alignment risk exists.</li>

            <li>Option 3: High trust as operations are independently controlled by trusted team members.</li>

        </ul>

 

        <h3>Location Advantage (Medium-Low Importance):</h3>

        <ul>

            <li>Option 1 & Option 3: Based in Quebec region with good relationships with Transport Canada regional engineers for both options.</li>

            <li>Option 2: May require BC-based operations; less relationship advantage compared to Quebec-based options.</li>

        </ul>
