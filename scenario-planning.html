    <h1>Scenario Planning (SP)</h1>

    <div class="option-block">

        <h2>Description:</h2>

        <p>Scenario planning involves creating detailed narratives about different future environments in which your organization might operate. This method helps in understanding how different organizational structures would perform under various hypothetical scenarios.</p>

    </div>

 

    <div class="option-block">

        <h2>Application:</h2>

        <p>By evaluating how each proposed structure might fare under potential future conditions (e.g., market changes, technological advancements), you can identify the most resilient and adaptable options.</p>

    </div>

 

    <div class="option-block">

        <h2>Future Environments:</h2>

        <ul>

            <li><strong>Future Environment A:</strong> STC on an older aircraft, consisting of an engine instrument glass panel on a DHC-7. Requires system level qualification (DO-254, DO-160) and aircraft level certification, including systems and equipment and flight test.</li>

            <li><strong>Future Environment B:</strong> STC on an aircraft that will require equipment certification, including structure, flight test and flight manual.</li>

            <li><strong>Future Environment C:</strong> Need to change the engineering process manual and the configuration management process document. Will need to get approval of these changes by Transport Canada regional engineer.</li>

        </ul>

    </div>

 

    <div class="option-block">

        <h2>Option Analysis:</h2>

 

        <h3>Future Environment A:</h3>

        <ul>

            <li><strong>Option 1 (AeroDonia):</strong></li>

            <ul>

                <li>Limited experience with DO-254 and DO-160 may hinder the project.</li>

                <li>Proximity to Transport Canada offers an advantage for certification.</li>

                <li>Existing frustrations of team members due to AeroDonia's disorganization could complicate project execution.</li>

            </ul>

            <li><strong>Option 2 (McDermott):</strong></li>

            <ul>

                <li>No direct experience in DO-254 or DO-178, but Tim's experience with DO-160 is beneficial.</li>

                <li>Large company resources might handle system-level qualification effectively.</li>

                <li>Risk of misalignment with McDermott's strategic interests could pose a challenge.</li>

            </ul>

            <li><strong>Option 3 (Own DAO):</strong></li>

            <ul>

                <li>Lack of experience in required standards could be a barrier, but ability to subcontract helps.</li>

                <li>Full control over processes ensures adherence to required standards.</li>

                <li>Relationships with Quebec region engineers facilitate the certification process.</li>

            </ul>

        </ul>

 

        <h3>Future Environment B:</h3>

        <ul>

            <li><strong>Option 1 (AeroDonia):</strong></li>

            <ul>

                <li>AeroDonia's existing contacts in the industry may help secure projects requiring equipment certification.</li>

                <li>Disorganized engineering practices could delay project timelines.</li>

            </ul>

            <li><strong>Option 2 (McDermott):</strong></li>

            <ul>

                <li>Assured work from McDermott’s fleet could provide consistent projects requiring equipment certification.</li>

                <li>Access to structural and powerplant expertise through Tim enhances capability.</li>

            </ul>

            <li><strong>Option 3 (Own DAO):</strong></li>

            <ul>

                <li>Full control ensures alignment with project requirements for structure and flight test certifications.</li>

                <li>Lack of admin structure may strain resources when managing multiple projects.</li>

                <li>Existing good relationships with Transport Canada engineers could streamline the certification process.</li>

                <li>The need to independently source projects could be resource-intensive.</li>

            </ul>

        </ul>

 

        <h3>Future Environment C:</h3>

        <ul>

            <ul>

                <li>Proximity to Transport Canada is advantageous for approval of process changes.</li>

                <li>Challenges with AeroDonia's internal disorganization might complicate the approval process.</li>

            </ul>

            <li><strong>Option 2 (McDermott):</strong></li>

            <ul>
