    <h1>Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA)</h1>

    <div class="option-block">

        <h2>Description:</h2>

        <p>MCDA is a decision-making framework that evaluates multiple conflicting criteria in decision making. This method is highly effective when choosing the organizational structure as it allows you to weigh different factors such as cost, efficiency, flexibility, employee satisfaction, and strategic alignment.</p>

    </div>

 

    <div class="option-block">

        <h2>Application:</h2>

        <p>By assigning weights to each criterion based on their importance and scoring each COA against these criteria, you can derive a ranking or score for each organizational model.</p>

    </div>

 

    <div class="option-block">

        <h2>Criteria Weights for Evaluation:</h2>

        <ul>

            <li>Control and Influence: Importance of having control over operations and influence in decision-making processes. MEDIUM-HIGH -> 4</li>

            <li>Certification Experience: The value of having existing experience with relevant aircraft certifications and standards (DO-160, DO-254, DO-178). MEDIUM-HIGH -> 4</li>

            <li>Liability Management: Importance of minimizing personal liability for team members. LOW -> 1</li>

            <li>Cost and Administrative Relief: Ease of administrative tasks, costly administration and support provided by the company structure. MEDIUM -> 3</li>

            <li>Project Acquisition: Ability to secure projects and work opportunities. MEDIUM-LOW -> 2</li>

            <li>Trust and Reliability: Trustworthiness and reliability of partners or associated companies. HIGH -> 5</li>

            <li>Location Advantage: Strategic advantage based on location, particularly in relation to Transport Canada. MEDIUM-LOW -> 2</li>
